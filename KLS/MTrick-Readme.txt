Enclosed is the demo. You can execute the file TestMTrick.m, and the MTrick algorithm is implemented in function MTrick.m. The file model_test.model is the model produced by logistic regression package, and pwz_common.pwz is produced by PLSA model. 
Here I do not provide you the logistic regression package, but you may find it through the following link http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/minka/papers/logreg/. 
Please write to me if there is any question (zhuangfz@ics.ict.ac.cn).
